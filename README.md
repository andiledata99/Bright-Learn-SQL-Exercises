SQL Learning Exercises – Andile Dube
This repository contains my hands-on SQL practice exercises, where I explored core database concepts through structured queries. Each exercise demonstrates practical problem-solving with SQL, focusing on data manipulation, aggregation, and cleaning techniques.

🚀 What I Learned
🔗 Exercise 4 – Joins
• 	Inner, Left, and Full Outer Joins
• 	Combining data across multiple tables
• 	Handling missing values in joins (NULLs)
• 	Grouping and aggregating joined data (e.g., total sales per region, task counts per project)
📅 Exercise 5 – Date Functions
• 	Using , , , and 
• 	Formatting dates with 
• 	Calculating ages, days between events, and days remaining until deadlines
• 	Working with timestamps for scheduling and tracking (e.g., meetings, blog posts, deliveries)
⚡ Exercise 6 – Null Handling
• 	Applying  to replace NULLs with defaults
• 	Using  statements for conditional logic
• 	Counting missing values in datasets
• 	Ensuring clean outputs for reports (e.g., “Not Assigned”, “Unknown”, “No Email”)
• 	Practical scenarios: salaries, grades, discounts, attendance, payments
🔀 Exercise 7 – UNION & UNION ALL
• 	Difference between  (unique results) and  (all results including duplicates)
• 	Merging customer and sales data from multiple sources
• 	Filtering high-value customers with conditions
• 	Tracking occurrences of repeat customers across datasets
• 	Summarizing totals with  and grouping results

🛠️ Skills Strengthened
• 	Data Cleaning → Handling NULLs, missing values, and inconsistent records
• 	Data Integration → Combining multiple tables and datasets with joins and unions
• 	Date & Time Analysis → Performing calculations with dates for scheduling, deadlines, and reporting
• 	Aggregation & Reporting → Summarizing data with , , and 
• 	SQL Best Practices → Writing clear, structured queries for real-world scenarios
